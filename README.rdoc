== README

This app is designed to hook into the Desk.com API and allow a user to do some very specific tasks:

* Present a list of cases available in the first case filter

* Present a list of labels

* Create a label called "prove it"

* Assign that label to the first case in the case filter

The app uses the <tt>unicorn</tt> as a webserver, and <tt>postgresql</tt> to work better with Heroku.
